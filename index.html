    <h1>🚴🏼‍♀️ Bikewatching</h1>
    <p>This website provides an interactive map visualization of bike traffic in the Boston area, focused on different times of the day. Here's a summary of its key features:

        Map Interface: Users can pan and zoom around a detailed map showing Boston-area roads and neighborhood labels, similar to Google Maps.
        
        Bike Lanes: Green lines overlay the map to indicate designated bike lanes, using data from the city governments of Boston and Cambridge.
        
        BlueBike Stations: Circles on the map represent BlueBike stations:
        
        Size indicates the volume of bike traffic at each station.
        
        Color shows whether more bikes are entering or leaving that station.
        
        Time Slider: A time-of-day slider lets users filter traffic data by hour, dynamically updating the station markers based on traffic patterns from about 260,000 rides in March 2024.
